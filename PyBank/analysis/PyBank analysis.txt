The PyBank Challenge definitely put me out of my comfort zone, I worked on this challenge for over a week (30+ hours) and only took baby steps. 
I signed up for a tutor and  am so glad I did, my tutor helped me out of my ditch and validated I was on the right track but steered me to the winning circle.
