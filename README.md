My first python coding exercise is to analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyBank
python main.py
Financial Analysis
 ----------------------------
-Total Months: 86
-Total: $38382578
-Average  Change: $-2315.1176470588234
-Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 $1926159
-Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 $-2196167


PyPoll exercise is using a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

* You will be give a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

### PyPoll
python main.py

Election Results
----------------------------
Total Votes: 3521001
----------------------------
Total Votes per candidate:
Khan:    (2218231)
Correy:  (704200)
Li:      (492940)
O'Tooley:(105630)
---------------------------------------
The Winner with the hightest count is:(2218231)
