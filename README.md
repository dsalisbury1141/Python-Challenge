My first python coding exercise is to analyzes the records to calculate each of the following informtion.
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

### PyBank
python main.py

Financial Analysis
 ----------------------------
<li>Total Months: 86</li>
<li>Total: $38382578</li>
<li>Average  Change: $-2315.1176470588234</li>
<li>Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 $1926159</li>
<li>Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 $-2196167</li>

My next exercise is using a small rural town modernize its vote counting process. Creating the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.

### PyPoll
python main.py

Election Results
----------------------------
Total Votes: 3521001
----------------------------
<li>Total Votes per candidate:
<li>Khan:    (2218231)</li>
<li>Correy:  (704200)</li>
<li>Li:      (492940)</li>
<li>O'Tooley:(105630)</li>
---------------------------------------
<li>The Winner with the hightest count is:(2218231)</li>
